            <h2>We believe that all environmental incidents are preventable.  </h2>
            <p>Our goal is to work safely while continuously improving environmental performance with each product we make, each process we use and each site we operate – pursuing a future free from environmental impacts that affect people or our planet.</p>
            <h3>Our company is committed to protecting the environment and human health through strategic focus on workplace safety and protection of the environment. </h3>
            <p>We strive for zero accidents, zero injuries and zero harm to people as we go about our daily business activities. We expect employees at our sites to display their commitment to this principle in their actions every day.</p>
            <h4>To achieve this we will:</h4>
            <p>Provide appropriate training for all employees with the right skills to do their work safely.</p>
            <p>Conduct a comprehensive and integrated health, safety and environmental management system by identifying risks, evaluating impacts and implementing controls.</p>
            <p>Get our people involved in decision making on issues that affect them.</p>
            <p>Encourage open communication of ideas and views throughout the Company structure.</p>
            <p>Encourage safe working practices through rewards, incentives and recognition programs.</p>
            <p>Reward those who contribute best to maintaining a healthy &amp; safe workplace as well as compliance first time around with a reduction in accident frequency rates, lower costs on repairs / maintenance at factories etc...</p>
            <p>Approach each situation calmly without rushing into action or judgement before circumstances are clear or can be assessed properly</p>
            <p>Establish an accident investigation system to determine the causes of incidents, using information from eyewitness accounts and other sources, both internal and external. </p>
            <h4>To demonstrate our commitment to zero harm, we will:</h4>
            <p>Give a clear statement that there is no tolerance for noncompliance with health, safety and environmental laws or policies. Accept responsibility for all accidents at all levels in the Company as well as those at subcontractor companies where we have influence over those operations. Conduct thorough investigations following major accidents to identify the causes so as to be able to prevent recurrence at any site within or outside Sri Lanka. Make corrective action an integral part of every investigation so as to eliminate the causes revealed by it. Document all investigations – even minor ones – in writing with action to be taken on all observations.</p>
            <p>We will communicate with affected people and the community at large acknowledging responsibility for any incident, explaining what happened and sharing information about corrective action. </p>
            <p>Where environmental damage has occurred, we shall help rehabilitate or compensate where appropriate.</p>
            <p>Issue safety alerts immediately on receipt of advice that some work is unsafe, or where we suspect that some work is or has become unsafe.</p>
            <p>Report the occurrence of injuries without any delay and provide all necessary information about the injury to monitor its course and outcome.</p>
            <p>Acknowledge responsibility for reporting all accidents to the workplace, even those considered minor – providing rapid, effective first aid – giving First Aid training – working closely with the Onsite First Aid Provider.</p>
            <p>Inform the Company immediately of any injury claim due to our actions, and ensure that you obtain a legal opinion from a lawyer or an insurance company regarding your liability before proceeding with any settlement discussions.</p>
            <p>We know what we need to achieve and have identified the necessary systems, processes and controls to do it.</p>
            <p>We have identified our HSE targets and will regularly monitor, review and report on progress in achieving them.</p>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring that our management system is effective in enabling us to achieve all of the above.</p>
            <p>The Occupational Health Safety Officer shall be responsible for coordinating programs, policies, procedures, rules &amp; regulations governing occupational health safety</p>
