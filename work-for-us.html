  <title>ANewView - Work For Us</title>
  <meta content="In today&#x27;s society, there are a plethora of companies who either pay their cleaners the minimum wage or even less. We, however, would not dream of doing this. All our team members employed in our cleaning division are paid above the government minimum wage for all working age adults, and also receive an extremely rewarding benefits package. To us it is only fair that we reward those who work hard for us with generous benefits and great pay, which is why we up the ante when it comes to offering competitive terms and conditions. Our cleaners are trained to a nationally recognised standard by our own in-house British Institute of Cleaning Science (BICSc) team. We believe in training from within wherever possible therefore never outsource any third party training. By employing our cleaners, we also expect them to be as committed as we are. We do not employ people who simply want a job on the side. All of our cleaning team is dedicated and wants to work within the industry long term. For this reason, we invest a lot into their training and development. This results in a cleaner who is more capable and makes a valuable asset to us! In return for offering such great pay and conditions with an investment in staff support, most of our cleaners have been working with us for several years now. In fact most of them have been key members of the team from very early on so they know all about our company culture too! Yes, it does mean that there has been consistency" name="description">

            <h2>Pay, training, Success</h2>
            <p>In society there are some companies that pay their cleaners the minimum wage or less. We, however, do not think this is fair. All of our team members who work in our cleaning division are paid above the government minimum wage for all working age adults and they get a great benefits package too. It is only fair to reward people who work hard with good benefits and good pay.</p>
            <p>By having our cleaners work for us, they are committed. We don&#x27;t have people who just want a job on the side. All of them want to be in this industry for a long time and they get trained so they know how to clean better. This way, we have a cleaner that is more capable and makes an important asset to us!</p>
            <h3>...and more pay</h3>
            <p>We offer good pay and good conditions for our cleaners. Most of them have been with us for a long time. They know how our company works.</p>
            <p>To ensure that our cleaning team can focus on what they do best, we employ all the latest technology to support them. We monitor performance and offer ongoing training to up skill our cleaners.</p>
